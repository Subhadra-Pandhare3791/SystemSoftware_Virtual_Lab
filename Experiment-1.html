			<h4 style="font-size: 22px">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 1.Introduction of Language Processor</h4>
			
			<b style="font-size: 20px">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *Semantic Gap:</b><p style="font-size: 19px">
			&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Language processing activities arise due to the difference between the manner in which a software designer describes the ideas concerning the behavior of software and the manner in which these ideas are implemented in a software system.
			The designer expresses the ideas in terms related to the application domain & to implement those ideas, their description has to be interpreted in terms related to the execution domain of a computer system
			We use the term semantics to represent the rules of meaning of a domain and the term semantic gap  to represent the difference between the semantics of two domains as shown in the following figure:</p>

			</center>
			<br>

			<b style="font-size: 22px">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *Consequences of semantic gap:</b>
			<ol style="font-size: 19px">
				<li>Large development times
				<li>Large development efforts
				<li>Poor quality of software
			</ol>
			<p style="font-size: 19px">These issues are tackled by software engineering through the use of methodologies and programming languages(PLs). 
			The software engineering steps aimed at the use of a PL can be grouped into:</p>
			<ol style="font-size: 19px">
				<li>Specification, design and coding steps
				<li>PL implementation steps

			</ol>
			<br>

			<b style="font-style:22px">*PL Domain:</b><p style="font-size: 19px">
				Software implementation using a PL domain introduces a new domain, the PL domain.
				The semantic gap between the application domain and execution domain is bridged by software engineering steps.
				The first step bridges the gap between Application domain and PL domain, while the second step bridges the gap between the PL domain and execution domain. </p>

				</center>
			<br>

			<b style="font-size: 22px">Specification Gap:</b>
				<p style="font-size: 19px">We refer the gap between application domain and PL domain as the specification-and-design gap or simply the specification gap.</p>
			<br>

			<b style="font-size: 22px">Execution Gap:</b><p style="font-size: 19px">
				The execution gap is bridged by the designer of the programming language processor namely a translator or an interpreter.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<b style="font-size: 22px">Advantages of implementing PL Domain::</b>
			<ol style="font-size: 19px">
				<li>The gap to be bridged by the software designer in now between the application domain and PL domain rather than between application domain and execution domain.
				This reduces the severity of the consequences of the semantic gap mentioned earlier.
				<li>Apart from the bridging gap between PL and execution domains the language processor provides capability to detect and indicate errors in the input.
				This improves the quality of software.

			</ol>

			<h4 style="font-size: 22px">2. Language Processing Activities</h4>
            <p style="font-size: 19px">We group fundamental language processing activities into two categories as:</p>
		
			<ol style="font-size: 19px">
				<li>Program Generation activities </li>
				<li>Program Execution activities</li>
			</ol>
			<br>
			<b style="font-size: 22px">a)Program Generation activities</b>
			<ul style="font-size: 19px">
				<li>It aims at automatic generation of program. Figure shows the Program Generation activities.</li>
				<li>The program generator is a software system which accepts the specification of a program to be generated and generates the program in the target programming language.</li>
			</ul>

			<b style="font-size: 22px">*Advantages in reduction in specification gap:</b>
			<ul style="font-size: 19px">
				<li>Increase the reliability of the generated program, as generated domain is close to the application domain.</li>
				<li>It is easy for the designer to write the specification of the program to be generated.</li>
			</ul>

			&nbsp &nbsp <b style="font-size: 22px">I) Program Translation:</b><br><p style="font-size: 19px"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The program translation model bridges the execution gap by translating a program written in programming language, called the source program in to equivalent program in the machine or assembly language of the computer system called the target program.</p>

			<ul style="font-size: 19px">
				<li>A program must be translated before it can be executed.</li>
				<li>A m/c language program generated by translator is saved in file and loaded in main memory and executed whenever desired.( No need to translate every time)</li>
				<li>Retranslation required after modification in source program.</li>
