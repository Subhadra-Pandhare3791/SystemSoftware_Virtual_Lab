		<ul style="font-size: 20px">
			<li>Lex is a program that generates lexical analyzer. It is used with YACC parser generator.</li>
			<li>The lexical analyzer is a program that transforms an input stream into a sequence of tokens.</li>
			<li>It reads the input stream and produces the source code as output through implementing the lexical analyzer in the C program.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<b style="font-size: 20px">&nbsp &nbsp &nbspThe function of Lex is as follows:-</b><br><br><br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <img src="lex.png" style="width:500px;height:300px;"><br><br>

		<ul style="font-size: 20px">
			<li>Firstly lexical analyzer creates a program lex.1 in the Lex language. Then Lex compiler runs the lex.1 program and produces a C program lex.yy.c.</li>
			<li>Finally C compiler runs the lex.yy.c program and produces an object program a.out.</li>
			<li>a.out is lexical analyzer that transforms an input stream into a sequence of tokens.</li>
		</ul>

		<b style="font-size: 20px">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lex file Format:-</b><p style="font-size: 20px">
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A Lex program is separated into three sections by %% delimiters. The formal of Lex source is as follows:-<br><br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp { definitions }   <br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp %%  <br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp { rules }   <br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp	%%   <br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp { user subroutines }</p>

		<b style="font-size: 20px">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Definitions</b> include declarations of constant, variable and regular definitions.<br>
		<b style="font-size: 20px">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rules</b> define the statement of form p1 {action1} p2 {action2}....pn {action}.<br>

		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Where pi describes the regular expression and action1 describes the actions what action the lexical analyzer should take when pattern pi matches a lexeme.<br><br>

		<b style="font-size: 20px">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp User subroutines</b> are auxiliary procedures needed by the actions. The subroutine can be loaded with the lexical analyzer and compiled separately.<br><br>
