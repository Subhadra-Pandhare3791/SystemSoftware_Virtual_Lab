		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The compiler writer can use some specialized tools that help in implementing various phases of a compiler. These tools assist in the creation of an entire compiler or its parts. Some commonly used compiler construction tools include:</p>
		<ol style="font-size: 20px">
			<li>Parser Generator</li>
			<li>Scanner Generator</li>
			<li>Syntax directed translation engines</li>
			<li>Automatic code generators</li>
			<li>Data-flow analysis engines</li>
			<li>Compiler construction toolkits</li>
		</ol>
		<h3 style="font-size: 20px">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 1. Parser Generator</h3><p style="font-size: 20px">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It produces syntax analyzers (parsers) from the input that is based on a grammatical description of programming language or on a context-free grammar. It is useful as the syntax analysis phase is highly complex and consumes more manual and compilation time.<br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Example: PIC, EQM</p><br>

		<h3 style="font-size: 20px">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 2. Scanner Generator</h3>
		<p style="font-size: 20px">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It generates lexical analyzers from the input that consists of regular expression description based on tokens of a language. It generates a finite automaton to recognize the regular expression.<br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Example: Lex</p><br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <img src="Scanner Generator.png" style="width:400px;height:200px"><br>

		<h3 style="font-size: 20px">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 3. Syntax directed translation engines </h3>
		<p style="font-size: 20px">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It generates intermediate code with three address format from the input that consists of a parse tree. These engines have routines to traverse the parse tree and then produces the intermediate code. In this, each node of the parse tree is associated with one or more translations.</p><br>

		<h3 style="font-size: 20px">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 4. Automatic code generator</h3>
		<p style="font-size: 20px">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It generates the machine language for a target machine. Each operation of the intermediate language is translated using a collection of rules and then is taken as an input by the code generator. A template matching process is used. An intermediate language statement is replaced by its equivalent machine language statement using templates.</p><br>

		<h3 style="font-size: 20px">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 5. Data-flow analysis engines</h3>
		<p style="font-size: 20px">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It is used in code optimization.Data flow analysis is a key part of the code optimization that gathers the information, that is the values that flow from one part of a program to another.</p><br>
		<h3 style="font-size: 20px">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 6. Compiler construction toolkits</h3>
		<p style="font-size: 20px">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It provides an integrated set of routines that aids in building compiler components or in the construction of various phases of compiler.</p><br>
