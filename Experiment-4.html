		<h3><br><h3 style="font-size: 28px; color: purple">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <b><u>Theory:</u></b></h3><br>

	   <p style="font-size: 19px">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tasks performed by the Pass-I are:-</p>
		<ol style="font-size: 19px">
			<li>Separate the symbol table, mnemonic table, and operand fields.</li>
			<li>Build the symbol table.</li>
			<li>Perform LC Processing.</li>
			<li>Construct Intermediate Representation (IR).</li>
		</ol>
		 <p style="font-size: 19px">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Pass-I performs the analysis of the Source Program and synthesize the IR.</p><br>
		 <p style="font-size: 19px">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Pass-I uses the following data structures:-</p>
		 <ol style="font-size: 19px">
			<li>OPTAB= A table of mnemonic opcodes and related information.</li>
			<li>SYMTAB= Table of Symbols used in the program.</li>
			<li>LITTAB= A table of Literals used in the program.</li>
			<li>POOLTAB= Table containing the information about the LITTAB.</li>
		</ol>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp<b style="font-size: 19px">LITTAB and POOLTAB</b><br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <ul style="font-size: 19px">
			<li>Literals are entered in the LITTAB in the sequential manner, along with two fields first one is literal and second is address of that literal.</li>
			<li>An entry in the POOLTAB indicates the number of pools of literals present in the input assembly language program.</li>
			<li>It contains only one field i.e. literal number. Literal number indicates which entry in LITTAB contains the first literal of the pool.</li>
			<li>In the assembly language program given below, there are two pools, the first one is before the LTORG statement and second is after LTORG statement to END statement.</li>
			<li>Pool one is having two literals =’5’ & =’2’ and again pool two is having two literals as =’9’ and =’1’. Hence LITTAB will have total four entries.</li>
			<li>Here both pools contains 2 literals, and hence POOLTAB will have the entries as 0,2 and 4.</li>
