					Software required to run the hardware parts of the computer and other application software.Acts as interface between hardware and user applications.Interface is needed because hardware device or machines and humans speak in different languages.English is pre-dominant language of interacting with computers.System software converts all human instructors into machine understandable instructions.

					Virtual Labs will provide to the students the result of an experiment by one of the following methods (or possibly a combination). Modeling the physical phenomenon by a set of equations and carrying out simulations to yield the result of the particular experiment. This can, at-the-best, provide an approximate version of the ‘real-world’ experiment. Providing measured data for virtual lab experiments corresponding to the data previously obtained by measurements on an actual system. Remotely triggering an experiment in an actual lab and providing the student the result of the experiment through the computer interface. This would entail carrying out the actual lab experiment remotely.
